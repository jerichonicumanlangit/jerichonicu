<h3 align="left">When I was young.. </h3>
<br>
<p align="left">I am Jericho Nicu T. Manlangit and I was born in Cagayan De Oro City, and I have two siblings. They are both men, which makes us three sons. Way back, I used to study here, the first school that I attended was at Fisher Valley Academy, which was just around Camaman-an. In their I studied from Nursery until Kinder 2. The photo above was from a United Nations Culminating Program during my time at the said school. After Kinder 2, my parents decided to work abroad, henced that we had to be taken care by our aunt and uncle in Bukidnon. There I continued to study from Kinder 2 again until I graduated Junior High School. </p>
