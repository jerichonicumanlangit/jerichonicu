<p align="left">Along my teenage years, my eldest brother had a hobby of Photography. This made him earn while he was studying in college. Looking up to him made me realize that I want to pursue photography and videography as well. Not for the reason of earning while studying, I just happened to love the scenario of work it has. You see smiles, sorrows, etc. Capturing events as such always makes me more passionate as to pursuing this dream. </p>
