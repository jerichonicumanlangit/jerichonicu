<h3 align="left"> I love to.. </h3>
<br>
<p align="left">During my growth, I had played a lot of sports. I used to play soccer, volleyball, tennis, and now I play Ultimate Frisbee. Which is very known with the term "Labay-labay ug plato". I became fond of it since junior high. Other than sports, I also love to spend my time with my devices which is my phone, personal computer, laptop, and my camera. I love being productive with the use of my devices as this does not proves that endulging with gadgets does not always result to laziness. Another hobby I have is taking photos or videos with my camera. I love doing this activity so much because not only that I enjoy it, I also value it at the same time as I see each photos and videos sentimental and valuable for me as I continue to live with memories stored in a digital format.</p>
